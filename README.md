# Project Instructions

This project uses two shell scripts:

- `complie.sh` – compiles the program
- `run.sh` – runs the compiled program

Depending on your environment, you can run these scripts slightly differently.

---

## Running with PowerShell (Windows)

If you are using **PowerShell** (e.g., in Windows or WSL), you can directly run the scripts using `sh`:

```powershell
sh ./complie.sh
sh ./run.sh
